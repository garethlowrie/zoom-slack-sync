# üì±üîÑ Zoom Slack Sync

Zoom Slack Sync is a serverless application built upon the [serverless framework](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/).

Get set up in a matter of no time! ‚è∞

All you need to do is:

1. Create a Slack app
2. Create a Zoom app
3. Clone this repo
4. Copy and fill out the .env file
5. Sign in to AWS on the CLI
6. Deploy with a single üëÄ `yarn deploy` command 
7. Users can (en/dis)able this integration by typing `/statusupdater` in your Slack workspace.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Prerequisites

-   An AWS account (We will be creating three Lambdas and a DynamoDB table)
-   Zoom user account with Developer permissions
-   Slack user account with the ability to create apps and add them to a workspace.

## How it works
### See it in action
The gif below outlines what this repo will allow you to achieve.

### OAuth Flow
Once set up, a user in your Slack workspace can start syncing their Zoom and Slack status' by typing `/statusupdater`.    
The user will then be asked to authorise the Slack app.

After authorisation the user will be informed the sync is now live.

The user can stop syncing their status' at any time by retyping the slash command `/statusupdater`.

## üë∑ Installation

First of all you will need to

1. Install [serverless](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/guide/installation/)

```bash
npm install -g serverless
- OR -
yarn global add serverless
```

2. [Give serverless access to AWS](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/guide/credentials#setup-with-serverless-config-credentials-command)

3. Clone this repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/garethlowrie/zoom-slack-aws-sync.git
```

4. Install the dependencies

```bash
npm install
- OR -
yarn
```

### ü§ñ 1. Create a Slack App

[Create a Slack App](https://api.slack.com/apps) and add it to your Slack Workspace.

#### Basic Information

-   Give you app a name like "Zoom Slack Sync" (this is how your App will appear in Slack).
-   Set an app icon, I've included a free one in this repo under `images` for you to use.

#### OAuth & Permissions

First add your Bot/User Token Scopes.

-   Bot Token Scopes: `commands` `chat:write` `im:write`  
-   User Token Scopes: `users.profile:write`.

Then go ahead and hit the **Install App to Workspace** button to add your App to Slack.  
**Redirect URL:** After running `yarn deploy` in `Step 3. Deploy` you will see an endpoint output in the terminal that ends with `/zoom-status-change-authorize-redirect` (Paste this in here).

#### Slash Commands

Go ahead and **Create a New Command** like `/statusupdater`. (Again, we will need to add the Request URL in Step 4 after deployment so just set it to be https://google.com for now.)

---

### ü§ñ 2. Create a Zoom App

You will need to [create a JWT Zoom app](https://marketplace.zoom.us/develop/create).

-   Tab: **Information** - Fill this tab out with your details
-   Tab: **App Credentials** - Generate a JWT
    -   _(Note: When your JWT expires you will need to redeploy in Step 3 with the new JWT)_
    -   Keep this to one side to put in your `.env` file later.
-   Tab: **Feature**
    -   Generate a Verification Token
        -   Keep this to one side to put in your `.env` file later.
    -   Add an **Event Subscription**
        -   **Name:** This can be anything
        -   **Event type 1**: `Meeting - Participant/Host joined meeting`
        -   **Event type 2**: `Meeting - Participant/Host left meeting`.
        -   **Event type 3**: `Meeting - End meeting`.
    -   **Event notification endpoint URL**: Come back to this in Step 4 (put a dummy url for now)
-   Tab: **Activate** - Don't activate yet. Come back to this in Step 4.

---

### üöÄ 3. Deploy

Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following.  
Environment variables prefixed with `CUSTOM_` are optional and have defaults assigned.  
I've outlined where you can find the values below.

```javascript
CUSTOM_EMOJI=:zoom:                   <Default: :calling: - This can be any emoji code in your Slack Workspace (custom too)>
CUSTOM_STATUS="On a call"             <Default: On a Zoom>
CUSTOM_SLACK_SLASH_COMMAND=syncstatus <Default: statusupdater>

AWS_REGION_DEFAULT=                   <AWS - e.g. eu-west-1>

SLACK_APP_ID=                         <Slack App - Basic Information Tab>
SLACK_VERIFICATION_TOKEN=             <Slack App - Basic Information Tab>
SLACK_CLIENT_ID=                      <Slack App - Basic Information Tab>
SLACK_CLIENT_SECRET=                  <Slack App - Basic Information Tab>
SLACK_OAUTH_TOKEN=                    <Slack App - OAuth and Permissions - Bot User OAuth Access Token>

ZOOM_VERIFICATION_TOKEN=              <Zoom App - Feature Tab>

SLACK_REDIRECT_URI=                   <This will be output after running yarn deploy, see below..>
```

Deploy your serverless application

```javascript
yarn deploy
```

Check your terminal output for an endpoint ending with `/zoom-status-change-authorize-redirect`.  
Add this to your `.env` file as the following

```bash
SLACK_REDIRECT_URI=https://abcdef.execute-api.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/dev/zoom-status-change-authorize-redirect
```

Deploy your serverless application for a final time.

```javascript
yarn deploy
```

---

### üë∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è 4. Go back and add the final bits

When you ran `yarn deploy` in Step 3 a number of endpoints would have been output in the terminal - we will need to add them to your Slack and Zoom apps.

1.  **Slack App: Update your Redirect URL**

    Go to the **OAuth & Permissions** tab and add the endpoint that ends with `/zoom-status-change-authorize-redirect` as a Redirect URL.

2.  **Slack App: Update your Slash Command Request URL**

    Go to the **Slash Commands** tab and add the endpoint that ends with `/slack` as a Request URL.

3.  **Slack App: Turn on Interactivity**

    Go to the **Interactivity & Shortcuts** tab and add the endpoint that ends with `/slack` as a Request URL.

4.  **Zoom App: Add your Notification Endpoint URL**

    Go to the **Feature** tab and add the endpoint that ends with `/zoom-status-change` as the Notification Endpoint URL in your Event Subscriptions.

5.  **Zoom App: Activate**

    Go to the **Activation** tab and hit the activate button.

## Using the integration

Once you have followed steps 1-4 above you should be ready to go! Head over to the Slack workspace where you installed your Slack App.

-   Type your slash command _e.g. /statusupdater_ and this should initiate the OAuth workflow by setting a button to the user that will take them to your Slack App's authorisation page. Once they click the button they will be redirected back to your Slack App and a message will inform the user that their status' are now in sync.
-   To stop syncing type your slash command again _e.g. /statusupdater_.

---

## üöß Debugging

Have you followed steps 1-4 and tried testing your integration and is something not working?

-   **Double check your Slack app and Zoom app are both configured correctly.**
-   **Check out the Lambda Logs**
    -   Log in to the _AWS Console_ and go to _Lambda_, you should see three lambdas called:
        -   **status-sync-dev-zoom-status-change-authorize-redirect**
        -   **status-sync-dev-zoom-status-change**
        -   **status-sync-dev-slack**
-   **Check our your DynamoDB table**
    -   Log in to the _AWS Console_ and go to _DynamoDb_, you should see a table called:
        -   **status-sync-data-table**
    -   When a user completes the OAuth flow they should appear in your DynamoDb table.
    -   When a user turns off the integration they should be removed from your DynamoDb table.
